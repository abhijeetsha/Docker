# Docker-All-Basic Commands & Explanations
## What is Docker..?
### Ans: Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.
These containers ensure that your app runs the same way on any system, regardless of environment differences.
### üîπ Key points:
  * A container is like a small, isolated environment for your app.
  * It includes everything needed: code, libraries, configuration, and runtime.
  * Containers are faster and more efficient than virtual machines.
  * You can easily build, ship, and run applications anywhere (e.g., your laptop, server, or cloud).

## What is Docker-File...?
### Ans: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions on how to build a Docker image.
   * Each instruction defines a step ‚Äî like choosing a base image, copying files, installing dependencies, and running commands.
###üîπ Example Dockerfile:
### # Step 1: Use a base image
   * FROM python:3.10
### # Step 2: Set working directory
   * WORKDIR /app
### # Step 3: Copy project files
   * COPY . /app
### # Step 4: Install dependencies
   * RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
### # Step 5: Command to run the app
   * CMD ["python", "app.py"]
### After that run Command for building Docker Images
   * docker build -t myapp .
### Ferm Images you can make Containers Command is:
   * docker run <imageid or image-name> 
### Docker reads this file and builds an image that you can run as a container.

## What is Docker Compose file..?
### Ans:Docker Compose is a tool that lets you define and run multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file called docker-compose.yml.
### Instead of starting each container manually, you define all services (like app, database, Redis, etc.) in one file and run them together.
###üîπ Example docker-compose.yml:
* version: '3'
* services:
  * web:
    * build: .
    * ports:
      * - "5000:5000"
  * db:
    * image: mysql:5.7
    * environment:
      * MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
### Then Run This Command:
  * docker-compose up
## üîÅ Summary:
  * Docker is Platform for running apps in containers with command is "docker run"
  * Docker File is a instructions to build an image FROM python 3.10
  * Docker-compose file is define manage multiple
